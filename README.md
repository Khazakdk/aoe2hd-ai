# aoe2hd-ai

The goal of this project is to teach myself AI scripting for Age of Empires 2 HD.  I will be following the Training AI by BearTheGreat,
which can be found here: http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=9686

The end goal is to produce an AI resonably capable of performing a "fast castle" strategy and can beat the first 3 levels of difficulty in a 1v1 skirmish against the default AI
